# Instructions

### 1. Install PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
```$ brew install postgresql postis```

### 2. Start PostgreSQL
```$ brew services start postgresql```

### 3. Create a database with PostGIS
``` $ psql postgres ```

### 4. Install GDAL
```$ brew install gdal```

### 5. Concert DTED to PostGIS format using raster2pgsql to load DTED files into DB
```$ raster2pgsql -s 4326 -I -C -M /path/to/dted/DTED/DTED1/DTED/DTED1/ /path/to/dted/DTED/DTED1/DTED/DTED1/ | psql -d <database> -U <user>```

## New
6. Run the script to download the database dump:
   ```sh
   chmod +x download_db.sh
   script/install.sh

# Project Idea
1. Create a web application that allows users to view and query DTED data. The application will display a map with the DTED data overlaid on top of it. The user will be able to click on the map to get the elevation at that point. The user will also be able to draw a line on the map and get the elevation profile along that line.

2. Create a program that allows users to input a pair of coordinates (starting and ending points) and get the shortest path between them. The program will use the DTED data to calculate the elevation profile along the path and use that information to find the shortest path. Maybe print the path on the map?.
